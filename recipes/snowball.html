    <h4>SnowBall</h4>
    <p>
      Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian
      teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago!
      With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery
      coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly
      the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 1/2 cup
        powdered sugar in a bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an
        electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour,
        pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into
        walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking
        sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops
        are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown:
        it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly
        before removing to wire racks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat, then return to
        the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar
        once more.
      </li>
    </ol>
